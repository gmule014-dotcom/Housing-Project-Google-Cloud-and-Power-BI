## 🔎 Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to **analyze housing data at scale**, uncover **market trends**, and provide actionable insights for stakeholders.  

Key steps in the workflow:  
- 📥 **Microsoft SQL Server** → Initial data ingestion, cleaning, and relational structuring  
- ☁️ **Google BigQuery** → Cloud-scale querying and data transformation using SQL  
- 🛠 **Power Query Editor** → Refinement, shaping, and data consistency checks  
- 📊 **Power BI Desktop** → Interactive reports & dashboards with real-time metrics  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL Server** – For staging, cleaning, and preparing raw datasets  
- **Google BigQuery** – For fast, scalable data warehousing and querying  
- **Power Query Editor** – ETL, cleaning, and schema adjustments  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Custom measures for KPIs  
- **Power BI Desktop & Service** – Dashboard design, publishing, and automation
